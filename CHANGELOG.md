# Changelog

All notable changes to `composer-license-checker` will be documented in this file

## Unreleased (3.0.0)

The major version was increased because of upgrades to the minimum required PHP version and other packages.

In practise, this upgrade should not require any changes on your end.

### Added

- Support for PHP 8.4. ([#49](https://github.com/dominikb/composer-license-checker/pull/49)
- Allow files for `--allowlist` and `--blocklist` to be passed as arguments. ([#51](https://github.com/dominikb/composer-license-checker/pull/51))
- Add `init` command to create a `.allowed-licenses` file for currently installed dependencies. ([#51](https://github.com/dominikb/composer-license-checker/pull/51))

### Changed

- Increase minimum required versions of `guzzlehttp/guzzle` to `7.4.5`
- Increase minimum required versions of `symfony/css-selector` and `symfony/dom-crawler` to major version `6` or `7`

### Removed

- Dropped support for PHP 7 and PHP 8.0 [(see: supported versions)](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)
